## What it does
Shows you some interesting visualizations of your facebook account.


## Producing locally  
Getting a working local copy of website requires a few steps: getting a copy of the site's code, and then adding lots of dependencies.  
  
Youâ€™ll need to have Python 3.5 available for code to work. Python 3.5.1 is installed on Ubuntu 16.04 by default. You can verify that by running the command _python3 --version_ in a terminal.

1.  Setup a _project_ folder to store everything:  
	```
    $ mkdir project     
      
    $ cd project
    ```
2.  Get a copy of the site's code by running a _git clone_:         

	```
    $ git clone https://github.com/Trailblazerr1/FaceMe-test.git      
    ```
3.  Now install all the dependencies:  

	```
    $ cd FaceMe-test
    $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
	If it throws error try installing pip by:
    ```
    $ sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```
4. Lastly sync the models by:

	``` 
	$ cd faceme
    $ python3 manage.py makemigrations
    $ python3 manage.py migrate
    $ python3 manage.py runserver
 ```
5. Now the terminal should end up looking like this:

	```
	Performing system checks...
	System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
    Django version 1.10.1, using settings 'faceme.settings'
	Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
	Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
```
6. Now skim over to     

	[127.0.0.1:8000/data/graph](127.0.0.1:8000/data/graph/)
    
	in your favourite browser.  
    
You now have a working  environment!
