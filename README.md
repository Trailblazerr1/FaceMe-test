## Producing locally  
Getting a working local copy of website requires a few steps: getting a copy of the site's code, and then adding lots of dependencies.  
  
Youâ€™ll need to have Python 3.5 available for code to work. Python 3.5.1 is installed on Ubuntu 16.04 by default. You can verify that by running the command _python3 --version_ in a terminal.

1.  Setup a _FaceMe_ folder to store everything:  

- Clone the repo by _git clone https://github.com/Trailblazerr1/FaceMe-test.git_.  
- pip3 install -r requirements.txt.  
- Change to directory which has manage.py.
- _python3 manage.py makemigrations_ (This might throw an error, keep going).  
- _python3 manage.py migrate_ (This might throw an error, keep going).  
- _python3 manage.py runserver_.
- Go to [127.0.0.1:8000/data/graph](127.0.0.1:8000/data/graph) 

The data provided here is mock-data and it doesn't communicates with fb in realtime.For further info see [this](https://github.com/Trailblazerr1/FaceMe).
